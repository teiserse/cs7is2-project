# CS7IS2 Picross Project

## Description

Picross (also known as nonogram) is a game played on a two dimensional grid. A list of numbers are attached to each row and column. These numbers represent the squares that need to be filled in by the user. An empty picross grid (left) is shown below, along with its solved counterpart (right).

For example, the number '3' is attached to row '0'. This means row '0' contains 3 coloured squares with no blanks in between one another. The numbers '1,2' are attached to column '0', which means there are 3 coloured squares in that column and a gap exists between one of the squares, and the other two (which have no blanks between themselves).

Multi-coloured picross images also exist. An example is displayed below.
